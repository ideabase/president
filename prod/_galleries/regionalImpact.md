					The Cleveland Urban Design Collaborative (CUDC) examined the relationships between two cities-Cleveland, Ohio and Havana, Cua. The 15-week studio, which took place in the spring of 2016, was sponsored by the Cleveland Foundation. Architecture and Environmental Design Graduate students Alexander Scott and Jordan Fitzgerald re-envisioned the Lakeshore Coal Plant as a regional destination for industrial arts preservation and production, located in close proximity to Cleveland's University Circle arts and culture district. The CUDC is the combined home of the urban design graduate program and the public service activities of the College of Architecture and Environmental Design.</p>
