Kent State University’s wealth of intellectual, physical and cultural resources makes it a whole that has a far greater impact than the sum of its parts. As a large eight-campus system with more than 41,000 students and offering more than 280 degrees from the associate to doctoral levels, Kent State is distinctively poised to serve as an exemplar of a re-imagined American research university – one that produces cutting-edge knowledge and new ideas while offering access to a high-quality education.  The 2015-16 academic year was a landmark year for the launch of a new vision and brand to better define the distinctive contributions of Kent State as a national public research university.
