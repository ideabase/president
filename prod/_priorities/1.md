Our top priority is to ensure that students have the education, experiences and support they need to graduate and to live successful, satisfying lives in their work and in their commitment to become engaged citizens. Attention to academic quality and student success is a cornerstone of a students-first environment. This focus begins with the strategic recruitment of talented and diverse students and continues with the commitment to support students as they learn to thrive in an academically challenging environment.
