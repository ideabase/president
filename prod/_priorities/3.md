As Kent State defines its distinctiveness as a national public research university, it is imperative that we position the university for success in an increasingly global environment. Efforts to enhance the university’s global competitiveness focus on continuing a trajectory of increasing the enrollment of international students and providing a high-quality global education for all of our students.
