		  <p>Kent State University is in the midst of a magnificent journey, powered by a vision that our collaborative community created together.  That vision, A Strategic Roadmap to a Distinctive Kent State, unfolds for you here through stories, images and data snapshots that illuminate our priorities and many of the achievements to date</p>
		  <p>As you will see, this community has aspirations to take the university to levels of distinction never before realized.  The Strategic Roadmap is designed to get us there.</p>
		  <p>Through the leadership of a 13-member Strategic Visioning Advisory Committee, the Strategic Roadmap is comprised of five priorities and 12 University-Level Initiatives (ULIs), all that map to the university’s compelling mission, vision, and values.  It also includes performance metrics to measure progress and a <a href="http://www.kent.edu/university-dashboard">University Dashboard</a> complete with six-year goals and both peer and aspirational institution comparative data.</p>
		  <p>With our Strategic Roadmap in hand and a dashboard to keep us pointed in our chosen direction, it is assured that we will reach our destination –<strong>a Distinctive Kent State.</strong></p>
			<p>With best regards,</p>
