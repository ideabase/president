Kent State University biology major Nirmala Ghimirey grew up in a refugee camp in Nepal. Upon coming to the U.S. at age 14, she met her mentors, Kent State Professor Dr. Terry Kuhn and Mrs. Elizabeth Kuhn, who told her about the biology program at Kent. Graduating from Akron’s North High School at the top of her class, Nirmala is now a student in Kent State’s Honors College preparing to graduate in December of 2016.  She has served as a tutor for both biology and chemistry and has earned numerous scholarships.  Nirmala landed a competitive research internship at the Moffitt Cancer Research Center in Tampa, Fla. where she was applauded for accomplishing more in one summer than some graduate students do in a year.  After graduation, Nirmala aims to continue her studies in medical school to earn both an M.D. and Ph. D.
