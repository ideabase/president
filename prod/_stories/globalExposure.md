Since a majority of Kent State’s College of Public Health courses are online, students can study anywhere in the world and stay on track with their degree—while gaining valuable exposure to other cultures.

During the two-week 2016 summer intercession, public health students studied in Brazil as part of Kent State’s partnership with the Oswaldo Cruz Foundation, one of the world’s main public health research institutions, located in Rio de Janeiro.

They received lectures on diseases endemic to Brazil—including malaria, leprosy, tuberculosis, Zika virus infections, non-communicable diseases and tropical diseases of the Amazon region—and they visited research facilities, communities, labs and clinics in Rio de Janeiro and Manaus (in the Brazilian Amazon).

“The Global Health Brazil Study Abroad course was fantastic,” says Mark James, Ph.D., professor and chair of the Department of Biostatistics, Environmental Health Sciences & Epidemiology and director of global programs for the College of Public Health. “It was a big success for the students and for the college’s global image.”
