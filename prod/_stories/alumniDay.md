Since the first Alumni Day of Service in 2009, Kent State University alumni and friends have given back on behalf of their alma mater by helping build homes, clean rivers and beaches, prepare meals for families, clean hospice centers, churches, shelters, historical societies and much more.

Karen Schofield, MEd ’77, has volunteered over the years at different service sites, such as Habitat for Humanity where she helped build a home. “A big motivator for me is knowing a family will benefit from my work,” she says. “I also get to meet folks from different age groups, graduation dates and majors. It’s always enjoyable.”

The Kent State Alumni Association continued the tradition on April 16, 2016 with volunteer projects planned in the following Ohio cities: Akron, Ashtabula, Canton, Chardon, Cincinnati, Cleveland, Columbus, Kent, Lorain, Medina, Painesville, Ravenna, Wooster and Youngstown—as well as in Los Angeles, New York, Phoenix, Pittsburgh, Raleigh and Washington, D.C.

“We hope to add even more cities this year,” says Lisa Mascellino ’94, assistant director of outreach for alumni relations. “We are proud of how well alumni have responded to this event, and it is exciting to hear about new alumni volunteers.”
