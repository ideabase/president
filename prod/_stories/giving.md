Golden Flashes and friends were asked to give back, and they rose magnificently to the challenge.

Kent State University's “#KSUGives” 2015 Giving Tuesday effort was a record-breaking success, as donors demonstrated their overwhelming generosity and Kent State pride. More than 700 alumni, faculty, staff, students, parents and friends contributed a total of $252,000 to initiatives that support Kent State’s outstanding people, programs and campuses.

Giving Tuesday is a global day of philanthropy which has been observed on the Tuesday following Thanksgiving since 2012, and Kent State has participated for the past two years. This year, however, was different, as President Beverly Warren personally matched gifts made on Giving Tuesday up to a total of $25,000.  President Warren’s donation was designated toward the Distinctive Kent State Fund, a new fund that has been created to provide support for the people and programs that set Kent State apart.

In addition to the president, two anonymous donors and Rob Senderoff, men’s basketball head coach, pledged $25,000 to match gifts to Intercollegiate Athletics. College of Architecture and Environmental Design faculty and staff pledged a combined $13,500 to match gifts to that program.

“The Giving Tuesday response from our alumni, friends, faculty, staff and students is remarkable,” said Jeffery McLain, vice president for institutional advancement. “President Warren’s leadership with a personal matching challenge is inspiring. The devotion to Kent State is evident in these results.”

Kent State community members were encouraged to take a moment to “give thanks by giving back,” and support a university college, campus or program of their choosing; they more than answered this call to action. This generous support will allow our academic programs and campus community to continue to reach even greater heights as we imagine a bold, brilliant and purpose-driven future.
