        <p>MESSAGE FROM THE PRESIDENT</p>

<p>Most reasonable people would not start a journey to anywhere important without a map and a plan. At the very least, you would use Google Maps, right?</p>

<p>Through a series of conversations and engagements over the past two years with thousands of members of the Kent State University family, it became very clear that this community has aspirations to take the university and its students to places and levels of distinction never before realized. And, so, we worked together to create the plan that will get us there.</p>

<p>A Strategic Roadmap to a Distinctive Kent State was developed through broad engagement across the university family under the leadership of a 13-member Strategic Visioning Advisory Committee. It is comprised of five priorities and 12 University-Level Initiatives (ULIs), all that map to the university’s compelling mission, vision, and values.</p>

<p>The Roadmap also includes performance metrics to measure progress and a University Dashboard complete with six-year goals and both peer and aspirational institution comparative data.</p>

<p>With our Roadmap in hand and a dashboard to keep us pointed in the right direction, it is assured that we will reach our destination – a Distinctive Kent State.</p>

<p>Beverly Warren,
President Kent State University</p>
